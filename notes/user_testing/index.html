	<p>User testing is an essential aspect of game design.</p>
	<p>Unlike other artistic disciplines, interaction is an essential component of game design, so we can't call our games finished until we test how people interact with them.</p>
	<p>Games are meant to be played, so we need to understand what works and what doesn't to make sure our work is playable.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>What to test for</h2>
	<p>Getting good feedback from users depends on asking good questions.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Play testing vs bug testing</p>
	<p>Bugs are problems with the game that are unintended by the developers. If the game crashes, or the controls stop working, or a collision doesn't work, those are bugs.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>We need to distinguish between bugs and and intended design choices that the player doesn't like or finds confusing. A jump that's too high is not a bug, it's a design choice.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>On-boarding</h2>
	<p>Does the player understand the basic controls and movement?</p>
	<p>Does the player understand basic goals and game mechanics?</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Play time</h2>
	<p>How long does the player play?  Do they make it to the end?  Do they give up?  Why?</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>It's good to have a goal in terms of the game play length.  A casual game might have a short play time, while a complex RPG could be played for dozens of hours.</p>
	<p>Does the player's play time match the expectation?  Why or why not?</p>
</div>


<div class="slide">
	<h2>Difficulty</h2>
	<p>Like play time, difficulty is going to vary among players. What we want to see is if our expectation of difficulty matches what players are reporting. If we expect the game to be easy, and it's rate high in difficulty, we may need to re-calibrate.</p>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Principles of testing</h2>
	<p>Expect your users to have little or no familiarity with gaming.</p>
	<p>Users have different levels of familiarity with gaming.  Don't assume a user is bad at gaming or doesn't understand something â€” it's the game designer's job to make things clear.</p>
	<p>That doesn't mean the game has to be easy.  It has to be clear.</p>
	<p>Seek both qualitative and quantitative feedback.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Quantitative feedback</h2>
	<p>Quantitative feedback is anything that uses numbers or scales.  This is useful to see if there is general agreement among testers.</p>
	<p>This is good for aspects of the games that can be quantified or rated.</p>
	<p>Ask users to rate aspects of the game on a scale.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Qualitative feedback</h2>
	<p>Qualitative feedback involves verbal or written resopnses that go beyond a number or scale.</p>
	<p>This is useful to give users more space to describe their thoughts and capture reaction that the designer may not have considered.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">

</div>

<div class="slide">
	<p>Start by choosing the elements of the game that are most important to it's success.  If the game relies heavily on narrative, ask the users to rate the narrative experience.</p>
