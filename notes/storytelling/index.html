<div class="slide">
	<p>In the previous lecture we looked at the history of augmented reality and some recent examples.</p>
	<p>Today we'll talk about the different forms of storytelling employed by interactive media and the challenges and affordances provided by new platforms.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Types of storytelling</h2>
	<p>Storytelling broadly refers to various techniques of revealing narrative or information to a listener or viewer.</p>
	<p>In the AR projects we have looked at so far, the storytelling technique tends to fall into two main types.  The first, adding information, is seen in many commercial contexts.  The second, which is harder to describe, but I'll generally call "magic," is adding a fictional layer on top of the real world.</p>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>New platforms</h2>
	<p>One of the challenges of using a new platform is creating works of art that make sense in the platform and move beyond the feeling of a "tech demo."</p>
	<p>This happens when it's obvious that a creator chose the platform before they chose the content.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<h2>Context</h2>
	<p>Creating a storytelling framing or context around a new media experience can help enhance the quality of the project by making it feel natural or embedded in an environment.</p>

	<p>The "Pip Boy" in-game UI device is a good example of "diegetic UI", or creating an interface within the game environment to add to the immersion of the game world.</p>
</div>


<div class="slide">
	<img src="pokemon_go.jpg" alt="pokemon go player in park">
	<p>Pokemon Go is successful in part because it taps into an already existing fictional universe that is familiar to players and the actions required by the game fit into that narrative naturally.</p>
	<p>Commercial experiences, like the Ikea furniture app, don't need narrative context because the commercial context is obvious.</p>

	<img src="race.png" alt="still from nytimes race a gold medalist app">
	<p><a href="https://rd.nytimes.com/projects/augmented-reality-storytelling#race-a-gold-medalist" target="_blank">Race a Gold Medalist</a> by the New York Times is a good example of an AR project that uses data to add a layer of context to an experience, making a clear case for the affordance of augmented reality.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<img src="ghosts-n-guns-ar-android.jpg" alt="ghosts and guns ar app images">
	<p>Narrative framing can be incredibly simple.  The game Ghost 'N Guns is successful because it allows the user to see ghosts in the real world.  Just the name is enough to connect to the platform.</p>
	<p>It's also interesting to contrast with Pokemon Go.  Both are single player experiences, but Pokemon Go creates mass gatherings, while Ghosts 'N Guns is played alone.  AR projects have to consider the physical context of the user.</p>
</div>

<div class="slide">
	<img src="Wonderbook.webp" alt="image of kid playing wonderbook ar game">
	<p>The PS5 project Wonderbook is a bit less successful considering the physical context of the user, requiring the user to open a book in direct vision of a camera and then view the animation on a screen above the book.</p>

	<h2>Interactive storytelling</h2>
	<p>Augmented reality is by it's nature interactive, even without UI buttons, using augmented reality typically gives the viewer more control of their experience, both in terms of time and space.</p>
	<p>Interactive stories use the juxtaposition on content through changing space and time to add a dimension of context to a narrative.</p>

	<p>The Kuleshow effect demonstrates how viewers derive meaning from the sequencing and context of visual information.</p>

	<p>Interactive comics like the collaborative <a href="http://e-merl.com/pocom.htm" target="_blank">PoCom</a> show how the spatial organization of interactive media adds new information, context and possibility to interactive storytelling.</p>
